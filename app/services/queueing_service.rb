  # the purpose of the QueueingService is to put profile ids scanned from the python script
  # into a daily_service's queue.
  # The goal of the queue is to have an order from which
  # canteen staff can serve student's meal (according to their place inside the daily_service's
  # i.e. according to the order of which they scanned their respective qr code)
  # 1. data from the python script's requests is validated through the VALIDATE_DATA_FROM_REQUESTS' method
  # 2. if data is to be found in the database, the EXECUTE_QUEUEING methods will run
  # and look for a daily_service in the database and retrieve it thanks to the RETRIEVE_DAILY_SERVICE method.
  # otherwise it will run the CREATE_DAILY_SERVICE method.
  # 3. both of these methods return a daily_service record
  # 4. inside which the profile ids will be put in queue.
