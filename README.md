# Quanttine

http://quanttine.herokuapp.com/

Quanttine is a web application that aims to reduce the food wasting in school canteens, by knowing what the students will eat so the kitchen's stock can adjust over this information.

To do so, we oganised the app around two ends : the Student and Kitchen.

		## Student end :

	* The user can pick his meal the day before, according to the avalaible stock.
	* He/she can modify or delete the meal selected.
	* The app will display the history of the meals ordered.
	* He/she can modify his profile, notify his dietary precautions and set an avatar.
	* A unique QR code will be applied to a student.

		## School end :

	* The school bursar can choose if wants to pay monthly or yearly.
	* Through the school dashboard, the kitchen can access to student's preferences.
	* The app will provide a recap of the stock.
	* The admin can add food items to the database.
	* He will have to set the menu of the next day, so the students can pick their meal.

# How does it works ?

	## Student end :

	* He/she first sign up to the website.
	* Once connected, he/she can pick a starter, a dish, a side and a desert.
	* The student will have to bring the QR code on his smartphone or printed on a sheet to scan it at the canteen counter
	* Enjoy :)

	## School end :

	* The school bursar have to enter the food quantities present in the stock to into the dashboard.
	* Then he/she will have to set the menu the day before each lunch.
	* At lunch time, once the student's QR is scanned, the meal of each student will be displayed on a screen in the kitchen.
